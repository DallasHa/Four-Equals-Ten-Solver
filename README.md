# Four = Ten Solver
<strong>4 = 10</strong> is a free mobile app in which four numbers are displayed for the user and the goal is to make the result equal 10 by dragging available operators in between numbers and applying a single, optional set of (brackets). You are able to reorder and swap the digits by dragging them around.
