# Four = Ten Solver
<strong>4 = 10</strong> is a free mobile app in which four numbers are displayed for the user and the goal is to make the result equal 10 by dragging available operators in between numbers and applying a single, optional set of (brackets). You are able to reorder and swap the digits by dragging them around.

Puzzles can not be skipped and users can only advance by completing each puzzle. Incorrect solutions display the total, but do not give the user the option to move on.

While the game may only ask for solutions that sum to 10, this program allows users to input a custom solution number to solve for:
